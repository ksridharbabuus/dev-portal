## How to update?
Firstly, when a new update is available you have to download the files with the updated content from [our Github](https://github.com/singnet/dev-portal).

You can go ahead and build the site again locally as usual.

If you only want the theme updates, simply delete your old theme folder and replace it with the new one.
